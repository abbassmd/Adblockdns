# 📱Mobile Config iOS for DNS Ad Block🔒

This repository contains two Mobile Config iOS files that can be used to block most of the ads on iOS devices.

##❓What is Mobile Config iOS? 📱🔧

Mobile Config iOS is a file format that allows you to configure various settings on iOS devices, such as email accounts, VPNs, Wi-Fi networks, and more. By installing a Mobile Config iOS file, you can quickly configure settings without having to manually enter them.

##❓What is DNS Ad Block?🚫📰

DNS Ad Block is a type of ad blocking that works by redirecting requests for ads to a "black hole" instead of serving the ad content. This is accomplished by using a specially configured DNS server that knows how to handle ad requests. DNS Ad Block can be more effective than traditional ad blockers because it blocks ads at the DNS level, before they are even loaded in the browser.

## 🔧How to use the Mobile Config iOS files📲💻

The two Mobile Config iOS files provided in this repository are configured to use a DNS server that is specifically designed to block most of the ads on iOS devices. To use these files, follow these steps:

2. Once the file is downloaded, open it on your iOS device. You can do this by tapping on the downloaded file in your browser, or by opening the Files app and navigating to the Downloads folder.
