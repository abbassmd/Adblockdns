## What is DNS Ad Block?

DNS Ad Block is a type of ad blocking that works by redirecting requests for ads to a "black hole" instead of serving the ad content. This is accomplished by using a specially configured DNS server that knows how to handle ad requests. DNS Ad Block can be more effective than traditional ad blockers because it blocks ads at the DNS level, before they are even loaded in the browser.
