# 📱Configuring DNS Ad Block on iOS Mobile Devices 🔒

This repository provides two Mobile Config iOS files that effectively block most ads on iOS devices.

## ❓What is Mobile Config iOS? 📱🔧

Mobile Config iOS is a file format that lets you configure settings on iOS devices, such as email accounts, VPNs, and Wi-Fi networks. By installing a Mobile Config iOS file, you can quickly configure settings without having to manually enter them.

## ❓What is DNS Ad Block?🚫📰

DNS Ad Block is a type of ad blocking that redirects requests for ads to a "black hole" instead of serving the ad content. This is done by using a specially configured DNS server that knows how to handle ad requests. DNS Ad Block is more effective than traditional ad blockers because it blocks ads at the DNS level, before they even load in the browser.
